BST BALANCED: O(log2(n))
BST easy to find largest/smallest keep going right 

Hepas must be complete for 2i+1/2 easy to find parent/child

Graphs show connections between people, graph theory number of 0 Î» = number of graphs

Graphs are not very structured, unlike every other data type

Every node (vertex) has a edges
V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} set of nodes
E = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) ... } Set of tuple of edges, connections

We focus on a simple graph, no self-loops, vertex pointing to itself
No vertice can connect to another one twice, only one arrow between vertices.

Directed, where order of edges matters, undirected where it does not.

We do not remove vertices, since we also have to remove all edges, too complicated for now

In degree: number of in neighbors (followers/being pointing to)
Out degree: number of out neighbors (following/pointing to)
