
If private code needs testing, code too complicated.
Test enough cases to be confident, including edge cases. 
Tests should keep passing when code updated*
One function for each behavior, unknown what is wrong if you test multiple things, helps isolate*
You can also do assertequal, assertlessthan, assertmorethan... **
Write tests before you code
Efficeincy depends on input and machine * 20 min washing machine good calculator 20 min bad.
Running time = n of operations * more important, universal
Sorting is log since as we go through theres less to sort, etc *
Omega, best case; theta, average case, O worst case, always talk about worst case ***
